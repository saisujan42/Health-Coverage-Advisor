# Health-Coverage-Advisor

Health-Coverage-Advisor is a machine learning-based web application designed to estimate the cost of an insurance premium for an individual. The project uses a Linear Regression model to predict insurance costs based on key factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and the number of children.

The web application is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input their details and receive a real-time estimate of their insurance premium.
